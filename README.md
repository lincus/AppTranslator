# AppTranslator
Translation engine designed for applications, it generates a translation for multiple languages at once.

1. Why a program like this exist and what is its purpose?
2. How this differ from a language translator (e.g. Google, Babylon, Bing)?
3. How can anyone benefit from this for their apps and games?
4. What are the possibilities and limitations?
5. How do we plan to make it work?

**1**. The idea for AppTranslator came from the following reasons
  - the need of an instant tranalation
  - good translations without overdo
  - speed up the process of making a translation and skip the task of finding people that can do the work of a translator

<br>

**2**. Lets take a quick comparison. The applications that we use to translate our works from foreign language and to translate conversations over the web, are engines very well engineered that use a collection of dozens of millions of archives to get the best captions to make the best translation possible and we know that with that, we are counting with dozens to hundreds of thousands of words from every language.
Something like AppTranslator do a similar job but in a very different way. On applications and games we are counting with a not very extent variety of words, in fact we are only counting with a few thousand different words and sentenses that are very often repeated from application to application and from game to game. With that, the creation of AppTranslator wont be that complicated as you can read forward on this file.

**3**. Anyone that want to apply this to their work and build tools for this, can integrate it on their favorite program, use it as a standalone, use it for any other end than just language translation for apps and games. For example, developers can use it to save a few hours or days of waiting for the translations to happen, and if a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is created for the average Joe, any user can use it to generate a translation for their favorite apps or games that lack a translation for their native language.

**4**. This is very important and shouldn't be ignored because it will save us a lot of time answering to anyone on the Q&A.
  The possibilities:
    - creation of easy translations
    - can be used for local and web software
    - can be extended to any language 
    - flexible list of usable words that can be easily customized
  The limitations:
    - only translate single words and short phrases
    - dialogues, tutorials and guides put into any app or game will suffer very rough and incomplete translations
    - translation is limited to the existing words included on the library of words being used by the engine
